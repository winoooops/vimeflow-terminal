# Vimeflow terminal fork

This repository is an Apache-2.0 tracking fork of
[`herdrdev/herdr`](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr). It preserves Herdr's
license and notices while carrying the native Vimeflow terminal work on a
separate product branch.

## Fork base

- Upstream repository: `https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr`
- Fork repository: `https://github.com/winoooops/vimeflow-terminal`
- Base tag: `v0.8.0`
- Base commit: `346411fa21afd297f5ed3b3fa56f9e3fbf7654b7`
- Bootstrap date: 2026-08-18

## Branch model

- `master` is a pristine, fast-forward-only mirror of `upstream/master`. Never
  commit fork changes there.
- `main` is the default product branch. It began at `v0.8.0` and carries all
  Vimeflow changes.
- Upstream releases are merged into `main` through review branches and pull
  requests, once per release rather than once per upstream commit.
- Fork feature work follows the same rule (since 2026-08-27): no direct
  pushes to `main` — every change lands through a reviewed GitHub PR tied to
  a tracked issue; fork CI gates the PR.

`origin` points to the fork and `upstream` points to `herdrdev/herdr`.

## Removed paths and upstream merge policy

`REMOVED_PATHS` is the machine-readable deletion registry. Each non-comment
line is either an exact repository-relative path or a directory prefix ending
in `/`. Fork CI compares those entries with `git ls-files`; a registered path
must have no tracked match.

- `master` remains a pristine fast-forward mirror. Registered deletions exist
  only on product branch `main`.
- Before each upstream release merge, fetch tags and review the upstream diff
  for every registered exact path and prefix.
- When upstream modifies a registered removed file, resolve the
  modify/delete conflict in favor of deletion on `main` only after deciding
  whether its behavior must be ported into a retained binary-essential or
  fork-owned path. Record any port as a normal fork modification.
- When upstream adds a file below a registered prefix, the guard fails. Delete
  it when it belongs to the retired surface. If it creates a real binary or
  test dependency, narrow or remove the registry entry in a dedicated
  reviewed PR; never silently force-delete the new dependency.
- Keep-but-exclude paths are not fork-edited. Accept the upstream side during
  merges and keep those paths outside fork workflows, packaging, and
  documented validation.
- A merge that resurrects a registered path must fail fork CI before reaching
  `main`; the guard does not inspect ignore rules or local Git configuration.

The remaining issue #3 tail is intentionally retained: repository-gated
upstream release/preview/Nix automation, `ci.yml`, Nix packaging inputs,
Windows ConPTY packaging consumed by `ci.yml`, and the high-churn website,
release, and `docs/next` sources. Those surfaces wait for fork-owned docs and
release decisions rather than being deleted piecemeal.

### Release-tag merge probe baseline

The Round 2b probe merged `v0.8.2`
(`9eb521456ac0d19d3ab3d9d7cea3cca10baa8a4c`) with
`--no-commit --no-ff` into cleanup commit `cf7d3c5b`, then aborted the merge
and removed the temporary worktree and branch.

The expected baseline is 11 content conflicts:

```text
AGENTS.md
Cargo.lock
README.md
docs/next/website/src/data/config-reference.json
justfile
src/app/mod.rs
src/app/state.rs
src/config/io.rs
src/config/model.rs
src/server/headless.rs
src/ui/sidebar.rs
```

There are 117 expected `deleted in main, modified in v0.8.2` conflicts:

| Registered set | Conflicts |
| --- | ---: |
| `.githooks/pre-commit` | 1 |
| `.github/workflows/website.yml` | 1 |
| `SPONSORS.md` | 1 |
| `docs/preview/` | 49 |
| `docs/versions/` | 61 |
| `workers/plugin-marketplace/` | 4 |

The retained, fork-modified `.github/workflows/issue-gate.yml` has one inverse
`deleted in v0.8.2, modified in main` conflict. Four paths merge as clean
upstream additions below registered prefixes and must then be rejected by the
reappearance guard: `website/assets/og-blog-yc-v1.png`,
`website/assets/where-do-agents-run-while-you-sleep.png`,
`website/assets/yc-logo.svg`, and `workers/plugin-marketplace/bun.lock`.

## Baseline

Rechecked on macOS arm64 with Rust/Cargo 1.96.1 on 2026-08-18:

| Command | Exit | Result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `cargo build --locked` with a cold Zig dependency cache | 101 | Zig 0.15.2 still received HTTP `400 Bad Request` for the themes tarball even though `curl` fetched the same URL with HTTP 200. This is local Zig-fetch behavior, not a dead artifact. |
| `cargo build --locked` after pre-seeding that tarball into Zig's package cache | 0 | Herdr built successfully. The fork did not modify the vendored dependency or build script. |
| Focused stock-announcement regression test | 0 | 1 passed, 0 failed. Stock manifest announcements remain disabled; the existing local-preview test remains intact. |
| Focused graphics cancellation test, 20 isolated runs | 0 | 20 passed, 0 failed. See the upstream baseline flake below. |
| `cargo test --locked` | 101 | 2936 passed, 2 failed: the untouched upstream graphics race and the raw-harness workspace-ID counter test described below. The announcement regression and all collateral `PoisonError` failures are gone. |

The cold-cache HTTP failure reproduces from the unmodified `v0.8.0` base. The
vendored dependency was not changed. CI fetches the artifact successfully on
both operating systems; macOS CI uses upstream's patched Homebrew Zig setup.

For a cold local Zig cache, run `scripts/preseed_zig_cache.sh` before
`cargo build --locked`. The script downloads the themes tarball and other
archives that Zig 0.15.2 fails to fetch locally, imports them into Zig's global
package cache, and rejects content hashes that no longer match the vendored
`build.zig.zon` manifests.

Upstream already shipped a macOS/Linux CI matrix, but its push trigger omitted
the fork's `main` branch. `.github/workflows/fork-ci.yml` supplies the requested
`cargo build --locked` plus the upstream `cargo nextest` test harness for pushes
and pull requests targeting `main` without modifying the upstream workflow.

Local Rust tests follow upstream CI: use `cargo nextest run --locked` on Linux
and `cargo nextest run --locked -E 'not binary(live_handoff)'` on macOS, where
upstream CI excludes that platform-sensitive integration binary. Raw
`cargo test` is not the project baseline because its shared-process harness
triggers the two known upstream failures below.

The inherited Nix workflow is disabled in this fork. Its nixpkgs
`importCargoLock` path downloads crates through `crates.io/api`, whose GitHub
runner requests currently fail with HTTP 403 because the fixed-output fetcher
does not expose a per-crate user-agent override. Local `nix build` remains the
packaging validation path and was validated with the watcher dependency's
registered `cargoLock.outputHashes` entry.

### Upstream baseline test behavior

- `api::server::pane_graphics_stream::tests::inactive_owner_cancels_idle_stream_and_dispatches_close`
  is order/timing dependent on slow raw-`cargo test` runners. At v0.8.0 the
  server writes the open acknowledgement before registering the stream, so the
  test thread can request cancellation before registration and then time out.
  Fork CI runs it under upstream's isolated nextest harness and retries exactly
  this test up to two times via `.config/nextest.toml`; fork code does not patch
  the graphics implementation or test. Two consecutive CI runs demonstrated
  that process isolation reduced but did not eliminate the race.
- `workspace::tests::generated_workspace_ids_are_short_base32_handles` assumes
  a fresh global workspace-ID counter. Raw `cargo test` shares that counter
  across the 2938-test unit-test process and can exceed the asserted two-digit
  range before this test runs. Upstream CI uses nextest's per-test processes,
  which preserve the test's intended isolation; fork CI now does the same.

## Upstream merge procedure

For each upstream release:

1. Fetch `upstream` and tags, then fast-forward local `master` to
   `upstream/master` and push that mirror to `origin/master`.
2. Create `sync/vX.Y.Z` from `main` and merge the signed or verified upstream
   release tag into it with a merge commit.
3. Compare changed upstream paths with the registry above. Resolve conflicts
   and registered deletions explicitly, retain the in-file notice on every
   fork-modified upstream source file, and update both registries and
   `MODIFICATIONS` in the same PR.
4. Run the macOS/Linux build-and-test matrix and review the complete diff.
5. Merge the sync PR into `main`; never auto-resolve conflicts or commit fork
   work directly to `master`.

## Deferred branding rename surface

The M0b bootstrap intentionally keeps the `herdr` binary/CLI name, socket and
state/config paths, environment variables, and command grammar so existing
Tier-1 plugins and operator workflows remain compatible.

A later, separately specified branding pass must inventory and migrate:

- Cargo package, binary, release asset, installer, and package-manager names;
- user-facing Herdr strings, help text, documentation, icons, and logos;
- socket/session identifiers, config/state/cache paths, and `HERDR_*`
  environment variables;
- plugin command contracts and a compatibility alias/migration period.

## M0b boundary note

`src/remote/unix.rs` also references Herdr-hosted manifests to provision a
matching binary on a remote host. It does not update the local fork and was
left untouched because M0b explicitly scopes neutralization to `src/update.rs`,
channel machinery, and product announcements. Reassess that remote workflow
before enabling remote execution in the fork.
